# reduction-algorithm-of-the-Soft-Error-Rate-SER-of-integrated-circuits
implementation of a parser that reads a circuit described in post-synthesis Verilog (ending in .v). 
In the a specific program will read the file and store the circuit (its components and their wiring) 
in properly defined and interconnected data structures. implementation of the main SER reduction algorithm. 
After applying the algorithm to the verilog file that will be given as input and return of a new verilog file
without altering the operation of the circuit. Evaluation of the SER of the rad-hard circuit with the tool of
estimation of the SER and evaluation of the results of the algorithm.
